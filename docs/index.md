# Dark Crystal Key Management

![dark crystal icon](./assets/dc_key.png)

Dark Crystal is a set of protocols, libraries, techniques and guidelines for secure management of sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. 

The idea is to make key management easy by emphasising trust between peers rather than individual responsibility.

It is a toolkit for developers who want to bring secure and easy to use key management techniques to their project.

- **Transport agnostic** - key backup and recovery mechanisms that work with your existing transport mechanism.
- **Flexible** - pick features which meet the needs of your individual project.
- **Easy to use** - includes template designs for making intuitive interfaces.
- **Empowering for peers** peers keys are secured by trust in their social network.
